# Forensic 10. (400)

Have a closer look to the payload! Its goal is to help the attackers to steal sensitive and valuable data. They have found a way out, unfortunately. Can you tell the management, what was stolen? What was the IP address, where the data went out? And exactly when (to hours and minutes)? What was the name of the first file stolen?

(example: hcsc{dest.IP.v.4_YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm_First_Stolen_Filename.ext})

Attention! The Time is in UTC (hours)!!!
